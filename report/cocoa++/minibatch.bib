@article{dbw-rsso-12,
	Abstract = {We analyze convergence rates of stochastic optimization
algorithms for nonsmooth
convex optimization problems. By combining randomized smoothing
techniques with accelerated
gradient methods, we obtain convergence rates of stochastic
optimization procedures, both in expectation and with high probability,
that have optimal dependence on the variance of the gradient
estimates. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
variance-based rates for nonsmooth
optimization. We give several applications of our results to
statistical estimation problems and provide experimental results
that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. We also
describe how a combination of our algorithm with recent work on
decentralized optimization yields
a distributed stochastic optimization algorithm that is
order-optimal.},
